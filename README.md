# DempsterShafer

This repo is an extension of the research I've been completing during my senior year Cognitive & Brain Science Seminar at Tufts University. This research focuses on Dempster-Shafer's Evidence Theory and the different similarity measures used to compare two separate bodies of evidence (BoE's). I've implemented this java library for further use in the research and development of embodied cognitive systems. In order to compile these files I've provided, you'll need to have the latest version of Apache Ant installed. Once installed, migrate Ant into the top level of this downloaded folder. Run the command ./ant dsjar to get a JAR of all the source code included.
